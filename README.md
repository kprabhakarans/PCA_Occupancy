# PCA_Occupancy
Principal Component Analysis is one of the most popular dimensionality reduction techniques which is tasked with reducing the dimensionality of big data sets. It results in us with smaller uncorrelated data which got transformed from the original large dataset with correlated variables. In this project, PCA is used on the Occupancy detection dataset to predict between occupants present or not present. Three different classification algorithms; i.e; Extra trees classifier (ET), K nearest neighbors (KNN), and Random Forest(RF) is applied to the original large dataset and then transformed the dataset after applying PCA into identifying the occupancy status. Each model is tuned with the ideal hyperparameters to obtain more suitable performance metrics and each algorithm's performance is measured and compared using the F1 score, confusion matrix and ROC (receiver operating characteristic) curves. The decision boundaries are also shown for all the models to show the model's understanding of the dataset. ET shows excellent performance comparatively over all other available ML models in the PyCaret library. In the end, an investigation is done on the interpretability of the model using the explainable AI (artificial intelligence) Shapley values. The extra trees (ET) classifier model is used for this purpose. To summarize, the algorithms successfully determine the two classes of Occupancy in the dataset and an F1-score of almost 1 is achieved.
